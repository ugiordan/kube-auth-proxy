# .gitleaksignore - Exclude test fixtures and mock data from Gitleaks secret scanning
#
# These are mock credentials used in unit tests and should not be flagged as security issues.
# Real credentials should NEVER be committed to this repository.
#
# Documentation: https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks#gitleaksignore
#
# NOTE: .gitleaksignore uses exact fingerprints from findings, NOT glob patterns.
# Format: <file-path>:<rule-id>:<line-number>
# To add new exclusions, run Gitleaks and copy the "Fingerprint:" from the finding.

# Test fixtures will be added here after first scan if needed

# Note: This file should be reviewed regularly to ensure test data exclusions remain appropriate.
# Production code and configuration files are still scanned for secrets.
